'But we must provide for the winter or else we shall suffer hunger,' said the Cat.  'You, little Mouse, cannot venture everywhere in case you run at last into a trap.'  This good counsel was followed, and a little pot of fat was bought.  But they did not know where to put it.  At length, after long consultation, the Cat said, 'I know of no place where it could be better put than in the church.  No one will trouble to take it away from there.  We will hide it in a corner, and we won't touch it till we are in want.'  So the little pot was placed in safety; but it was not long before the Cat had a great longing for it, and said to the Mouse, 'I wanted to tell you, little Mouse, that my cousin has a little son, white with brown spots, and she wants me to be godmother to it.  Let me go out to-day, and do you take care of the house alone.''Yes, go certainly,' replied the Mouse, 'and when you eat anything good, think of me; I should very much like a drop of the red christening wine.'\\n\\nBut it was all untrue.
